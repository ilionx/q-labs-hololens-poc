# qlabs hololens project

This github repository is made to help users with basic hololens applications. We found out that many functions are not easily implemented. Our goal is to make these implementations as easy as possible. These implementations are based on the Microsoft Tutorials.

We started with this project from our findings in making an app. We wanted to give new collegues the possibility to get to know teams and projects based on information showed in the desired room. To create this app we first needed to know multiple smaller aspects.

1. How to see an object on the same position over multiple sessions.
2. How to create objects and bind scripts to them.
3. How to get information from a backend to display on an object.

We created multiple proof of concepts to demonstrate that these aspects are possible. In this project you will find multiple folders, each containing the corresponding aspect as stated above.
